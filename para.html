            The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. 
            The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
             To select an element with a specific id,
             write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element<br>
             <p>
                The CSS ID selector matches an element based on the value of the element's id attribute. 
                In order for the element to be selected,
                 its id attribute must match exactly the value given in the selector.
             </p>
